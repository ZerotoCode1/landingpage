                        The declaration of the Vietnam War, particularly regarding American involvement, is marked by
                        key events in the 1960s. Following the Geneva Accords in 1954, which divided Vietnam into North
                        and South, the U.S. began supporting the South Vietnamese government against the communist North
                        led by Ho Chi Minh, laying the groundwork for deeper military engagement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The situation escalated dramatically after the Gulf of Tonkin Incident in 1964, where reported
                        attacks on U.S. naval vessels to seek congressional approval for military action. This led to
                        the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, granting the president the authority to take military action in
                        Vietnam without a formal declaration of war.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result, U.S. troop presence in Vietnam surged, peaking at over 500,000 troops by 1969. This
                        commitment was framed as necessary to prevent the spread of communism in Southeast Asia.
                        Ultimately, the Vietnam War was characterized by a series of political maneuvers rather than a
                        formal declaration, reflecting the complexities of Cold War dynamics.

                    One of the most significant events was the Tet Offensive in 1968. Launched during the Lunar New
                    Year,
                    this massive surprise attack by North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces targeted major cities and
                    military
                    bases across South Vietnam. Despite suffering heavy losses, the offensive shocked the American
                    public
                    and shifted perceptions about the war, illustrating the resolve and capability of the Vietnamese
                    forces
                    to challenge U.S. military power.

                <p>Another crucial engagement was the Battle of Khe Sanh, which took place from January to April 1968.
                    This
                    battle involved a prolonged siege of a U.S. military base by North Vietnamese forces. While American
                    troops
                    managed to hold the base, the battle drained significant resources and morale, impacting the overall
                    war
                    effort and demonstrating the challenges faced by U.S. forces in the harsh terrain of Vietnam.</p>
                <p>The Battle of An Loc in 1972 also played a vital role in the conflict. Occurring from April to June,
                    this
                    battle was marked by a significant North Vietnamese attack on the town of An Loc in Binh Phuoc
                    Province. As
                    part of the summer offensive, it showcased the strength and determination of North Vietnamese
                    forces,
                    further solidifying their commitment to liberating the South.</p>
                <p>Finally, the Ho Chi Minh Campaign in April 1975 marked the culmination of the Vietnam War. This
                    decisive
                    offensive aimed to liberate South Vietnam, culminating in the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975. This
                    victory
                    signified the end of the war and led to the reunification of Vietnam under communist control,
                    fulfilling the
                    long-held aspirations of the Vietnamese people.</p>
                <p>In summary, these key battles reflect not only the military prowess of the Vietnamese forces but also
                    their
                    resilience and commitment to achieving independence and reunification. Each battle played a crucial
                    role in
                    shaping the course of the war and solidifying Vietnam's historical legacy.</p>

                The Paris Peace Accords, signed on January 27, 1973, aimed to end the Vietnam War and outline the
                withdrawal of U.S. forces. A key element was a ceasefire to halt hostilities between North and South
                Vietnam, along with the withdrawal of all U.S. military personnel within 60 days. The agreement also
                included provisions for the return of prisoners of war and sought a political settlement between the two
                Vietnamese governments.
