                        In August 1945, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the
                        Central Committee of the Indochinese Communist Party, launched a general uprising to seize power
                        and establish the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. However, shortly thereafter, the French
                        colonialists returned to invade.

                    <p>
                        On December 19, 1946, the nationwide resistance war broke out, marking a major turning point in
                        the national liberation revolution. Ho Chi Minh's "call for national resistance" aroused the
                        patriotism and indomitable will of the nation. At the end of 1946, the French colonialists took
                        many provocative actions, forcing the Vietnamese Government to respond.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Faced with the invasion plot, the Vietnamese people decided to take up arms to defend
                        independence and freedom. On December 19, 1946, the decision to launch a nationwide resistance
                        war was made, affirming the determination to defend the Fatherland.

                        <p class="text-content-box">Beginning (1946): On December 19, 1946, the nationwide resistance war broke out after France
                            sent an ultimatum demanding the Vietnamese Government to disarm its self-defense forces.

                        <p class="text-content-box">Early stage (1946-1947): Fighting took place in many places, the
                            guerrilla movement developed strongly, especially in the northern mountainous region.
                            Middle stage (1948-1950): Viet Minh organized major campaigns, consolidated forces and built
                            bases.
                            Decisive stage (1953-1954): The Battle of Dien Bien Phu, which took place from March to May
                            1954, was an important turning point, leading to the defeat of the French army.

                <p>Another crucial engagement was the Battle of Khe Sanh, which took place from January to April 1968.
                    This
                    battle involved a prolonged siege of a U.S. military base by North Vietnamese forces. While American
                    troops
                    managed to hold the base, the battle drained significant resources and morale, impacting the overall
                    war
                    effort and demonstrating the challenges faced by U.S. forces in the harsh terrain of Vietnam.</p>
                <p>The Battle of An Loc in 1972 also played a vital role in the conflict. Occurring from April to June,
                    this
                    battle was marked by a significant North Vietnamese attack on the town of An Loc in Binh Phuoc
                    Province. As
                    part of the summer offensive, it showcased the strength and determination of North Vietnamese
                    forces,
                    further solidifying their commitment to liberating the South.</p>
                <p>Finally, the Ho Chi Minh Campaign in April 1975 marked the culmination of the Vietnam War. This
                    decisive
                    offensive aimed to liberate South Vietnam, culminating in the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975. This
                    victory
                    signified the end of the war and led to the reunification of Vietnam under communist control,
                    fulfilling the
                    long-held aspirations of the Vietnamese people.</p>
                <p>In summary, these key battles reflect not only the military prowess of the Vietnamese forces but also
                    their
                    resilience and commitment to achieving independence and reunification. Each battle played a crucial
                    role in
                    shaping the course of the war and solidifying Vietnam's historical legacy.</p>

                    After years of fierce war, both sides realized the need to find a peaceful solution. The intervention of the US and international forces created pressure to force the parties to sit down for negotiations.

                   The parties agreed to end all military activities, with the U.S. committing to withdraw all troops and advisors from South Vietnam within 60 days. The Agreement affirmed the Vietnamese people's right to self-determination and called for free elections to establish a government in the South.

                 <p class="sub-content-3">
                  The terms of the Agreement were not fully implemented, leading to ongoing conflict. The resistance war against the U.S. ultimately ended with the victory of the Vietnam People's Army and the liberation of the South on April 30, 1975.

                 While the 1973 Paris Agreement did not immediately end the conflict, it facilitated significant progress in Vietnam's struggle for independence and unification.
