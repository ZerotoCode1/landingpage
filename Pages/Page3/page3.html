        <p class="des-1">Hồ Chí Minh (May 19, 1890 – September 2, 1969), born Nguyễn Sinh Cung, and also known as Uncle
            Hồ (Bác Hồ),
            was a Vietnamese revolutionary and politician. He was the founder of the Communist Party of Vietnam and
            served as the President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from 1945 to 1969. He was also the Prime
            Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from 1945 to 1955, General Secretary of the Central Committee
            of the Vietnam Workers' Party from 1956 to 1960, and President of the Central Committee of the Vietnam
            Workers' Party from 1951 until his death.
        </p>
        <p class="des-2">Before rising to power, Hồ Chí Minh traveled through many countries and continents and is
            believed to have
            used between 50 and 200 different pseudonyms. Politically, Hồ Chí Minh adhered to Marxist-Leninist ideology.
            He was the leader of the Viet Minh independence movement and led the August Revolution of 1945. He also
            drafted and read the Declaration of Independence that established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam,
            becoming its President following the 1946 general elections.</p>

                <div class="box-des-2">
                    <p class="des-content-2">Võ Nguyên Giáp (August 25, 1911 – October 4, 2013), born Võ Giáp, also
                        known as General Giáp or
                        Anh Văn, was a Vietnamese military leader and politician. He was the first General and the
                        Supreme Commander of the Vietnam People's Army, one of the founding members of the Democratic
                        Republic of Vietnam. He is highly regarded by the Vietnamese government as "an outstanding and
                        close student of President Hồ Chí Minh." He was the commander of the campaigns during the
                        Indochina War (1946–1954), the Vietnam War (1955–1975), and the Vietnam–China Border War (1979).
                    </p>

                    <p class="des-content-2">Originally a history teacher, he is considered one of the greatest military
                        leaders in Vietnam's
                        history. He was hailed by many newspapers as a national hero of the Vietnamese people. Võ Nguyên
                        Giáp also read and was influenced by many historical leaders, such as Carl von Clausewitz, Sun
                        Tzu, George Washington, and Vladimir Lenin. However, he personally considered T. E. Lawrence and
                        Napoleon to be the two figures who had the greatest impact on him. Western media even referred
                        to him as the "Red Napoleon" due to his military leadership that completely defeated France's
                        invasion plans in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, a victory that shocked the world. General
                        Giáp was also a strategic logistics mastermind and is recognized as the principal architect of
                        the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which transported weapons and soldiers from North Vietnam to the South
                        through Laos and Cambodia. The trail is acknowledged as one of the greatest feats of the 20th
                        century in military engineering and logistics management.</p>

                    <p class="des-content-2">Võ Nguyên Giáp is often credited with playing a key role in the military
                        victory of the
                        Democratic Republic of Vietnam over the United States and the Republic of Vietnam. His military
                        career is considered more distinguished compared to other leaders, with his former subordinates,
                        Văn Tiến Dũng and Hoàng Văn Thái, later taking on more direct military responsibilities than
                        Giáp himself. However, he played a crucial role in transforming the Vietnam People's Army into
                        one of the largest and most formidable combined and mechanized forces capable of defeating the
                        Army of the Republic of Vietnam in conventional warfare.</p>

            <div class="full-content-3">
                <p class="des-content-3">His full name was Lê Trọng Tố, born on October 1, 1914, in Nghĩa Lộ village, An Định hamlet, Yên Nghĩa commune, Hoài Đức district, Hà Đông province (now Yên Nghĩa ward, Hà Đông district, Hanoi). According to the book "Họ Trịnh và Thăng Long" (The Trịnh Family and Thăng Long), published by the National Culture Publishing House in 2000, written by researchers Bỉnh Di and Trịnh Quang Vũ, it is affirmed that General Lê Trọng Tấn is a descendant of the Trịnh Căn family.</p>
                <p  class="des-content-3">His father, known as Cụ Đồ Lê (or Năng), was involved in the Đông Kinh Nghĩa Thục movement. After the movement was suppressed, he returned to his hometown in Thanh Nhàn and started a school to teach Confucian literature. In 1926, Cụ Đồ Lê, along with Nhượng Tống, organized a memorial service for Phan Châu Trinh at the Hai Bà Trưng Temple in Đồng Nhân village</p>
                <p  class="des-content-3">Born into a family of scholars, he attended the Bưởi School in Hanoi during his youth. He was a bright student with a strong passion for martial arts and football. He played as a midfielder for the Eclair (Lightning) football team. Due to his football achievements, he was recruited into the French Air Force football team and enlisted in the colonial Red Regiment, serving at a garrison near Tông (Sơn Tây) airport. Since he wore the rank of đội (equivalent to a corporal), the villagers of Yên Nghĩa (near Tông airport) often called him "Đội Tố".</p>
                <p  class="des-content-3">Bà Bích Vân (also known as Hoàng Ngân), who was in charge of logistics and military affairs for the Bắc Kỳ Regional Committee, along with some other contacts, was tasked with recruiting Đội Tố, which she successfully accomplished. Lê Trọng Tấn joined the Việt Minh in 1944 and became a member of the military committee of the Hà Đông province's uprising committee in August 1945. After the August Revolution, he became a member of the Indochinese Communist Party.</p>
